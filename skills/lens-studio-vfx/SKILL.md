description: Reference guide for Lens Studio's VFX Graph particle system — covering VFXComponent setup (VFX asset vs Component relationship), reading and writing .asset.properties to pass data into a VFX graph at runtime (position, color, float, direction vectors), particle system inspector settings (emitter rate, lifetime, shape, blending, world vs local simulation space), spawning particles from script (trigger emission via properties), sending scene object transforms and screen-space data to VFX, and common VFX bugs (type mismatches on properties, asset null checks). Use this skill whenever a lens needs particle effects, camera-reactive or gesture-driven VFX, attaching effects to face/body tracking anchors, or connecting real-time data (position, audio levels, expression weights) into a VFX graph.

# Lens Studio VFX — Reference Guide

Lens Studio's **VFX Graph** system lets you build GPU-accelerated particle effects visually. Scripts control VFX by writing to the graph's exposed **properties**, not by calling imperative particle APIs.

---

## Core Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **VFX Asset** | The `.vfx` file — the graph definition with exposed properties |
| **VFXComponent** | The scene component that runs a VFX Asset on a scene object |
| **Properties** | Named, typed inputs on the asset that scripts can read/write |

```typescript
// Get the VFX component on the scene object
const vfx = this.sceneObject.getComponent('Component.VFXComponent')

// Check the asset is assigned before accessing properties
if (!vfx || !vfx.asset) {
  print('[VFX] Asset not assigned!')
  return
}

// Access the properties object
const props = vfx.asset.properties
```

---

## Writing Properties to a VFX Graph

The VFX Graph exposes **named properties** that are declared inside the graph editor. Match the property name exactly (case-sensitive) and the type must match.

### Supported property types

| Type | Example |
|---|---|
| `number` | `props['intensity'] = 0.8` |
| `boolean` | `props['emitting'] = true` |
| `vec2` | `props['uvOffset'] = new vec2(0.1, 0.2)` |
| `vec3` | `props['spawnPosition'] = new vec3(0, 1, 0)` |
| `vec4` | `props['color'] = new vec4(1, 0.5, 0, 1)` |
| `quat` | `props['orientation'] = someQuat` |

```typescript
// Set a float intensity property
vfx.asset.properties['intensity'] = 0.5

// Set an emission position from another scene object
const sourcePos: vec3 = sourceObject.getTransform().getWorldPosition()
vfx.asset.properties['spawnPosition'] = sourcePos

// Set a colour via vec4 (RGBA, [0, 1])
vfx.asset.properties['color'] = new vec4(1.0, 0.3, 0.0, 1.0)

// Toggle emission on/off
vfx.asset.properties['emitting'] = true
```

> **Type mismatch warning**: if the value type doesn't match what the graph expects, the property silently does nothing. Use `typeof` or a debug print to confirm the type before writing.

## Sending Transform Data to VFX

### World position
```typescript
updateEvent.bind(() => {
  const pos = anchor.getTransform().getWorldPosition()
  vfx.asset.properties['targetPosition'] = pos
})
```

### World rotation (as vec4 to avoid quat-to-prop issues)
```typescript
const rot = anchor.getTransform().getWorldRotation()
vfx.asset.properties['rotation'] = new vec4(rot.w, rot.x, rot.y, rot.z)
```

### Direction vector
```typescript
const forward = anchor.getTransform().forward  // vec3
vfx.asset.properties['emitDirection'] = forward
```

### AABB mesh dimensions (for bounding-box-shaped emitters)
```typescript
const meshVisual = anchor.getComponent('Component.RenderMeshVisual')
const aabbMax = meshVisual.mesh.aabbMax.mult(anchor.getTransform().getLocalScale())
const aabbMin = meshVisual.mesh.aabbMin.mult(anchor.getTransform().getLocalScale())
vfx.asset.properties['boundsMax'] = aabbMax
vfx.asset.properties['boundsMin'] = aabbMin
```

---

## Screen-Space to World-Space Conversion

To spawn particles at a 2D screen position (e.g., where the user tapped):

```typescript
// Given: a ScreenTransform and a Camera
function screenToWorld(screenTrans: ScreenTransform, camera: Camera, desiredDepth: number): vec3 {
  const anchors = screenTrans.anchors
  const center  = anchors.getCenter()
  const anchorHalfHeight = anchors.getSize().y / 2
  const fov = camera.fov
  const depth = (desiredDepth / anchorHalfHeight) * 0.5 / Math.tan(fov * 0.5)
  const screenPos = screenTrans.localPointToScreenPoint(center)
  return camera.screenSpaceToWorldSpace(screenPos, depth)
}

// Usage: spawn VFX at the tapped screen position
vfx.asset.properties['spawnPosition'] = screenToWorld(screenTrans, mainCamera, 250)
```

---

## Particle System Inspector Settings

These are configured in the Lens Studio **VFX Graph editor**, not in script — but knowing them helps when authoring the graph.

| Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Emitter Rate** | Particles spawned per second (or per burst) |
| **Lifetime** | How long each particle lives (in seconds) |
| **Simulation Space** | `World`: particles stay where emitted; `Local`: particles move with the emitter |
| **Blend Mode** | `Additive` for fire/glow, `Alpha` for soft particles, `Normal` for opaque |
| **Shape** | Sphere, Cone, Box, Mesh surface — defines the spawn volume |

> **World vs Local simulation**: use **World** space for fire or smoke that should trail behind a moving emitter. Use **Local** for effects that rigidly follow the emitter (e.g., a sparkle around a held object).

---

## Attaching VFX to Face / Body Tracking Anchors

```typescript
// Parent the VFX object to a face tracking anchor in the scene hierarchy
// (drag it under the `hat` or `mouth` anchor in the inspector)
// Then in script, send expression weights to drive emission rate:

const faceTracking = headObject.getComponent('FaceTracking')

updateEvent.bind(() => {
  const expressions = faceTracking.getFaceExpressionWeights()
  const mouthOpen = expressions[FaceTracking.Expressions.MouthOpen]

  // Drive particle emission rate by mouth opening
  vfx.asset.properties['emitRate'] = mouthOpen * 50  // 0–50 particles/sec
  vfx.asset.properties['emitting'] = mouthOpen > 0.3
})
```

---

## SpawnOnTap Pattern

```typescript
@component
export class SpawnOnTap extends BaseScriptComponent {
  @input vfxPrefab: ObjectPrefab

  onAwake(): void {
    const tapEvent = this.createEvent('TapEvent')
    tapEvent.bind(() => {
      // Instantiate a new VFX instance at the tap position
      const instance = this.vfxPrefab.instantiate(null)
      // Position it (TapEvent gives screen position — use WorldQueryModule for 3D hit point)
      instance.getTransform().setWorldPosition(spawnPos)

      // Destroy after the effect finishes
      const cleanup = this.createEvent('DelayedCallbackEvent')
      cleanup.bind(() => instance.destroy())
      cleanup.reset(3)  // 3 seconds
    })
  }
}
```

## Common Gotchas

- **Property name must match exactly** — property names in the VFX graph are case-sensitive. Always log `Object.keys(vfx.asset.properties)` during development to see what's available.
- **Asset null check**: always guard with `if (!vfx || !vfx.asset)` — if the asset isn't assigned in the inspector, the property access will throw.
- **Type mismatch is silent** — passing a `number` to a `vec3` property won't error; it just won't work. Match the type exposed in the VFX graph.
- **Simulation space matters** — a `Local`-space emitter attached to moving content may produce unexpected particle trails; switch to `World` if that happens.
- **Writing properties every frame is fine** — VFX property writes happen on the CPU; the GPU reads them at emit time. Don't worry about performance for single-value writes.
- **`VFXComponent` is not `ParticleSystem`** — Lens Studio's VFX Graph is separate from the legacy Particle System component. They have different APIs and can't be mixed.
